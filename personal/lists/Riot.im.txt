Riot.im is a open-source federated chat, using JavaScript instead of PHP, and thanks to it Riot can be ported to ZeroNet, to be from federated to a true distributed/decentralized instant messenger
It supports chat groups and uses bridges, which enables integration/communication with other platforms
