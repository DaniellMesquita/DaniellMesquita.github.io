I support the best computing keyboard layout, Colemak:

(ZeroNet mirror not available yet)

Soon I'll create a video teaching about Colemak and my adventures trying it, and help the colemak_pt-br layout
Also, I need to help users to use it on my OS Floflis, and let them earn open-badges by learning it
